### Windows Build Instructions ###

This example assumes that you are familiar with the simple example in "examples/console" directory

Install Qt. There are many ways to do this.
One easy way is to obtain Qt pre-built binaries (VisualStudio) here http://code.google.com/p/qt-msvc-installer/

Use CMake to configure and generate the examples in "examples/gui" directory.
Select the Qt and GetSet directories if they are not found.
Hint: You can add the Qt and GetSet paths to the CMAKE_PREFIX environment variable, so they will be found automatically.
If Configure is successful, click Generate and close CMake
