//  Package: AutoGUI
//  Copyright (c) by André Aichert (aaichert@gmail.com)
//
// This a simple example program showing how a console application can be
// configured by a host process through an auto-generated GUI. This method
// is useful, whenever you need to focus on algorithm development and when
// you cannot or do not want to link to large GUI-libraries, such as Qt.
// 
// In addition, the host can be rewritten using different libraries without 
// re-building the client. The client can be run on systems where no GUI is
// available if you configure it directly through ini-files.
// 
// This package is part of (and depends on) the GetSet libraries.
// See also: http://sourceforge.net/projects/getset/
//
// Do whatever the * you want with this code.
